  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> May 20, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Countus ("we", "our", or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Countus mobile application (the "App"), an all-in-one counter solution that includes stopwatch, countdown timer, tally counter, and recurring timer features. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is designed to help you track time and habits, such as timing workouts, setting reminders for events, or logging daily activities, all while operating offline to ensure maximum privacy and control.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    To use the App, you must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be at least 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction, e.g., 16 in certain regions under GDPR).</li>
    <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
    <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you are using the App on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. License to Use the App</h2>
  <p>
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms. You may:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App to create, manage, and track counters (e.g., stopwatch, countdown, tally, or recurring timers) on your device.</li>
    <li>Access features such as habit tracking, reminders, and statistical insights as provided by the App.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.</li>
    <li>Distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the App or its features to third parties.</li>
    <li>Use the App for any illegal, unauthorized, or prohibited purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    As a user of the App, you agree to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the App in a manner consistent with its intended purpose, such as tracking time or habits.</li>
    <li>Secure your device to prevent unauthorized access to the App and its locally stored data (e.g., counters and labels).</li>
    <li>Be responsible for any content you create within the App, such as counter names or labels, ensuring they do not violate any laws or infringe on third-party rights.</li>
    <li>Not use the App to engage in harmful activities, including but not limited to distributing malware, spamming, or attempting to exploit the App’s functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The App, including its design, code, graphics, and all associated content, is owned by Countus or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy, reproduce, or create derivative works of the App without prior written permission.</li>
    <li>Use the Countus name, logo, or trademarks for any purpose without express consent.</li>
    <li>Claim ownership or rights over any part of the App or its features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any counters or labels you create within the App are stored locally on your device and remain under your control. We do not claim ownership of user-generated content.
  </p>

  <h2>6. App Functionality and Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided "as is" and operates entirely offline, with all data stored locally on your device using React Native’s AsyncStorage. We strive to ensure the App functions as intended, but we do not guarantee:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation of the App.</li>
    <li>Compatibility with all devices or operating systems.</li>
    <li>Recovery of data if the App is uninstalled or your device is lost, damaged, or reset.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You acknowledge that the App’s features, such as stopwatch, countdown, tally, and recurring timers, depend on your device’s performance and settings. We are not responsible for issues arising from device limitations or user error.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Countus and its affiliates, officers, or agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your use of or inability to use the App.</li>
    <li>Loss of data due to device issues, uninstallation, or failure to back up data.</li>
    <li>Any errors, inaccuracies, or interruptions in the App’s functionality.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized access to your device or data due to inadequate device security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The App is a productivity tool, and you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of any timers, counters, or reminders before relying on them for critical tasks (e.g., medical reminders or time-sensitive events).
  </p>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at our discretion, without notice, if:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You violate these Terms.</li>
    <li>Your use of the App is deemed harmful, illegal, or disruptive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may terminate your use of the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device, which will delete all locally stored data associated with the App. We do not retain or back up any user data.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms to reflect changes in the App’s functionality, legal requirements, or our policies. Changes will be communicated by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Updating the "Effective date" at the top of this document.</li>
    <li>Posting the revised Terms within the App or on our official website (if applicable).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your continued use of the App after the effective date of any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Countus App Development Team is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by law.
  </p>
