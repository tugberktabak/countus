  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> May 30, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Countus ("we", "our", or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a Custom End User License Agreement ("Custom EULA") governing your use of the Countus mobile application (the "Licensed Application"), an all-in-one counter solution that includes stopwatch, countdown timer, tally counter, and recurring timer features. By downloading, installing, or using the Licensed Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Licensed Application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Licensed Application is designed to help you track time and habits, such as timing workouts, setting reminders for events, or logging daily activities, all while operating offline to ensure maximum privacy and control. The Licensed Application is licensed, not sold, to you, and Countus reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Scope of License</h2>
  <p>
    Countus grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control, subject to these Terms and the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions (the "Usage Rules"). You may use the Licensed Application for personal, non-commercial purposes, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating, managing, and tracking counters (e.g., stopwatch, countdown, tally, or recurring timers) on your device.</li>
    <li>Accessing features such as habit tracking, reminders, and statistical insights as provided by the Licensed Application.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed Application, except to the extent permitted by applicable law or by licensing terms governing open-source components included in the Licensed Application.</li>
    <li>Distribute, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Licensed Application or its features to third parties.</li>
    <li>Use the Licensed Application over a network where it could be accessed by multiple devices simultaneously, except as permitted by the Usage Rules.</li>
    <li>Copy the Licensed Application, except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules.</li>
    <li>Use the Licensed Application for any illegal, unauthorized, or prohibited purpose.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you sell or transfer your Apple device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the device beforehand. These Terms govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application, as well as any upgrades provided by Countus that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a new Custom EULA.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    To use the Licensed Application, you must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be at least 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction, e.g., 16 in certain regions under GDPR).</li>
    <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
    <li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you are using the Licensed Application on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Consent to Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Licensed Application operates offline, and all data (e.g., counters, labels, and timers) is stored locally on your device using React Native’s AsyncStorage. You agree that Countus may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your device, system, and application software, gathered periodically to facilitate software updates, product support, and other services related to the Licensed Application. Such information will be in a form that does not personally identify you. Countus may use this information to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    As a user of the Licensed Application, you agree to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Licensed Application in a manner consistent with its intended purpose, such as tracking time or habits.</li>
    <li>Secure your device to prevent unauthorized access to the Licensed Application and its locally stored data (e.g., counters and labels).</li>
    <li>Be responsible for any content you create within the Licensed Application, such as counter names or labels, ensuring they do not violate any laws or infringe on third-party rights.</li>
    <li>Not use the Licensed Application to engage in harmful activities, including but not limited to distributing malware, spamming, or attempting to exploit the Licensed Application’s functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    The Licensed Application, including its design, code, graphics, and all associated content, is owned by Countus or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy, reproduce, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application without prior written permission.</li>
    <li>Use the Countus name, logo, or trademarks for any purpose without express consent.</li>
    <li>Claim ownership or rights over any part of the Licensed Application or its features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Any counters or labels you create within the Licensed Application are stored locally on your device and remain under your control. Countus does not claim ownership of user-generated content.
  </p>

  <h2>7. External Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Licensed Application may enable access to third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use External Services at your sole risk. Countus is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services and shall not be liable for any such External Services. Data displayed by any External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical, or location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Countus. You will not use External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with these Terms or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Countus or any third party. Countus reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.
  </p>

  <h2>8. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>
    YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. COUNTUS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY COUNTUS OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL COUNTUS, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF COUNTUS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Countus’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above-stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Licensed Application is a productivity tool, and you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of any timers, counters, or reminders before relying on them for critical tasks (e.g., medical reminders or time-sensitive events).
  </p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    This Custom EULA is effective until terminated by you or Countus. Your rights under this Custom EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You violate these Terms.</li>
    <li>Your use of the Licensed Application is deemed harmful, illegal, or disruptive.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You may terminate your use of the Licensed Application at any time by uninstalling it from your device, which will delete all locally stored data associated with the Licensed Application. Countus does not retain or back up any user data.
